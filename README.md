# CVD-web
This is the medical web platform developed as part of my BSc dissertation at Newcastle University. It allows doctors to classify and visualise Cardiovascular Diseases using Machine Learning.

The model developed for the web platform is a Random Forests Classifier. Its development can be found here:
