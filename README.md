# CVD-web
This is the medical web platform developed as part of my BSc dissertation at Newcastle University. It allows doctors to classify and visualise Cardiovascular Diseases using Machine Learning.

A demo of the platform can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iMGJAlFaW4xnFVXgEHPHNiJUWB_plbup/view?usp=sharing

The model developed for the web platform is a Random Forests Classifier. Its development can be found here:
